I written to codes:

- main.cpp I used the approach I was thinking by creating a map that would hold each number from the vector as a key and increment every time I see the number
- main2.cpp I used the simple approach suggested by using the unique operator to find the unique value in a vector

Both codes can be compiled usig: 

```
  g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp
  g++ -std=c++17 main2.cpp
``` 

Thanks for the Opportunity!
